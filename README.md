# Card-Game-29
I'll create a simple implementation of the 29 Card Game in Python. The 29 Card Game is a trick-taking game popular in South Asia, typically played with 4 players in partnerships using a 32-card deck (7 and above from each suit). The goal is to win tricks to score points, with a target of 29 points.
